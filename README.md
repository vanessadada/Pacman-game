# Programming Assignment 8
  * This program try to visualize the pacman game by using the javafx library
  * The GuiPacman class contain the method to Initialize the game image and show it on the stage
  * The myKeyHandler class is private that is setted to control the move direction of pacman through arrow keyboard by user. Also game over check is in this class. If game is over, the pacman cannot move and the semi transparent layer with game over word will appear
  * The Tile class is also private that is used to Initialize the image information from the board about pacman game like pacman, ghosts, and dot.

# Extra credit
  * I add the cherry as bonus. If the pacman eat the cherry, it will get 200 points. Also the cherry is not static, it will move randomly, which largely increase the difficulty of the game.
